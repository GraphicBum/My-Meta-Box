My Wordpress Meta box Class
=======================
Contributors: bainternet
Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: 3.5

Description
-----------
The Meta Box Class is used by including it in your plugin files and using its methods to 
create custom meta boxes for custom post types. It is meant to be very simple and 
straightforward. For name spacing purposes, All Types metabox ( meaning you can do anything with it )
is used. 

This class is derived from Meta Box script by Rilwis<rilwis@gmail.com> version 3.2. which later was forked 
by Cory Crowley (email: cory.ivan@gmail.com) The purpose of this class is not to rewrite the script but to 
modify and change small things and adding a few field types that i needed to my personal preference. 
The original author did a great job in writing this class, so all props goes to him.

Usage
--------
Take a look at the `class-usage-demo.php` file which can also be tested as a WordPress Plugin. 
Other options are available for each field which can be see in the 'my-meta-box-class.php' file, 


Known Issues and Limitations
-------------
Reapater field can't handle Posts and Taxonomy for now (and maybe even others).
